  <p>
    constructor cannot be extended/overridden
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    constructor can be overloaded with different signature
  </p>

    static is used for memory management , all objects share static variable of a class
  </p>
  <p>
    static methods can be called using ClassName.staticmethod()
    static methods cannot access/call nonstatic class variable/methods
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>static method cannot be inherited in the sub class because they belong to the class in which
      they have been declared</b>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    final variables remain constant in program execution and cannot be changed.
  </p>
  <p>

    outer class cannot be declared private.
  </p>
  <p>
    encapsulation can be done via private class variables/getters/setters
